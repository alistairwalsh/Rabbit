          <p>This software is part of a larger research project into open source hardware and software for physiological research.
The GSR and HRV sensors were built successfully and operated reliably and accurately. The GSR device was wireless and battery powered, had SD card storage and concurrent transfer of information to a paired computer.</p>

<p>A number of different versions of the HRV device were built showing wireless and battery powered operation, the use of displays, storage to a memory card and battery power. Several different techniques of detecting the heart beat were explored including Electrocardiogram (ECG) using electrodes on the chest as well as detecting readings from a Polar heart rate belt. Reflectance and absorbance based plespomorphy on the fingertip and earlobe was also tested as an alternative to the more common detection of electrical activity of the heart. A technique where a second $\mu C$ is used to access the operation of the HRV device is also shown.</p>

<p>The EEG and nIR devices proved more difficult and no working devices were developed in the time frame of the study. The stages of development that were achieved suggest that it would be possible to build these devices given more time and resources. The main barrier to the development of the EEG device was the size of the data generated by such a device. The barrier to developing the nIR device was the lack of information from other researchers who have built these devices. This will likely improve as this technique is used more.
 The OpenBCI project launched their open source EEG amplifier on Kickstarter during the time frame of this research but it was not possible to obtain a unit for testing. The results released by the OpenBCI project suggest that this device would be a viable open source alternative to an EEG amplifier. They have also made progress on 3D printed electrode headsets for use with the amplifier.</p>

<p>An EEG device with one channel (Fp1), using a non-open source chip from Neurosky was developed and tested. This device recorded activity at the frontal site and transmitted strength in EEG bands to an attached computer. The power in these bands was displayed in a real-time display. While the processing of the EEG signal was not done with open source hardware, the transmission and display of the information was. This further demonstrates the flexibility of open source devices in a mixed open source/ proprietary system.  </p>

<p>The preliminary work for developing a nIR sensor was conducted and a open source spectroscope from Public Lab was evaluated. Theory about the response was examined and suppliers of the required nIR light emitters and detectors were located. The technique has many similarities to plespomorphy and the work done on the HRV sensor will inform further development of this device. </p>

<p>Software used in this research played an important role and the following software proved useful for use in human factors research. The pieces of software together for an integrated tool chain that greatly enhances the productivity of researchers from presentation of stimuli to collection of data, analysis and reporting of findings. The ability now to write code could be seen in the same way that being able to use Microsoft Word and Excel were 15 years ago. Coding could be considered a new requirement for research.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Arduino IDE and associated Processing language.</li>
<li>The Python programming language within the iPython IDE. The Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Pyserial libraries,  installed with the Anaconda Python Distribution</li>
<li>The R statistical analysis platform with Knitr and LaTeX for document preparation</li>
<li>Psychopy for stimulus presentation using Python and access to data from hardware devices from within an experiment</li>
</ol><p>Conclusions that can be made from this work are both general to the field of open source software and hardware and specifically to these devices. Open source hardware and software are not just an alternative to propriety systems, they generally outperform them. Open source also has much better  inter-operability where the hardware and software form a tool chain that speeds research and presents fewer barriers to achieving the final result. Open source software is also more secure due to its openness, the source code must available for examination to be called open source. This means many experts have looked over the code and a security flaw or intentional back door is unlikely to escape the attention of every observer. </p>

<p>Building hardware allows greater specificity of operation. The device is bespoke and can provide a precise answer to an experimental question. The qualifier is that if there is a level of complexity and a level of robustness required beyond ``domestic'' use, building these devices would not be a good choice. The increasing availability of small run electronic hardware production is an alternative if greater robustness and complexity is required.
Although it is possible to build something like an EEG amplifier using open source plans and hardware, this is not an efficient use of time and resources and the result would be inferior. Purchasing a device like the OpenBCI EEG amplifier board gives all the benefits of open source but is sturdier and more compact than what is possible for an individual to build. This is not to say an experienced hardware builder could not create an equivalent device. It is acknowledging that this takes experience and practice that a human factors researcher may not have developed. Locating an open source project that is already established also means more mature software and resources from the community around the device. These communities are the intangible but highly valuable resource of open source.</p>
